### Pi zero Bash Bunny

Why:
1) I already had a pi zero w, and though It would be interesting
2) Pi zero w has wifi built in which would allow more extensive attack's and logging
3) I like a challenge :)
4) a $10 device is more "Disposable" then a $100

This will not be a full replacement for a bash bunny, the bash bunny has a full ssd ( Much better speeds then a sd card ) And if you are using it for pen testing, would be much more likely to be plugged in by a target then a pi zero with a 3d printed case, Plus the guys at Hak5 do an amazing job of comunity develpment, and comming up with great out of the box ways of pen testing. I am not a pro pen tester, and only am interested in seeing if I can get it to work.

Current Status
[ WORKS ]
* ATTACKMODE successfully sets devices up
* bunny_helpers.sh Gets target_ip and other device info

[ Yet to do ]
* ATTACKMODE needs to be able to change device mode after initilized
* need a switch setup
* need a way to have an "Arming Mode" where I can upload payloads as a flash drive
